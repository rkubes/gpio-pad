Small proof of concept utility to map joystick inputs to Raspberry Pi GPIO outputs

At this point in time, this utility is just a proof of concept and not intended to be widely used. Much of the code will be inflexible at first to fit my specific needs. If I wind up having more use for this code and can give time to make improvements, I may open it up to enhancements. For now, the intention is to be read-only for reference to those pursuing similar ideas.
